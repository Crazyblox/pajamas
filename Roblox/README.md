# Roblox - pajamas:

This is the directory for the Roblox runtime version of pajamas.

This directory is compatible with importing directly into Roblox Studio.

In order to use pajamas in Roblox Studio, create a Folder in your experience with the same name as your download of this directory; then use file-sync to import the files into Roblox Studio.

It is recommended to disable file-sync once you have imported all the files to prevent risk of deleting or duplicating data due to a pajamas project requiring to be sat in the pajamas root directory in order to run.

#### Rojo

Pajamas has already been setup as a Rojo project. Given the latest version of Rojo, serve in the root folder to find Pajamas in `ReplicatedStorage` under `Pajamas`. You can edit the `default.project.json` file to change this behaviour.
